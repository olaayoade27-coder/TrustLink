## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `import_attestation(admin, issuer, subject, claim_type, timestamp, expiration)` for historical migration from an external verified source.
- `Attestation.imported` flag so imported records are distinguishable from native attestations.
- `imported` event for an auditable attestation migration trail.
- `set_fee(admin, fee, collector, fee_token)` and `get_fee_config()` for configuring attestation creation fees.
- `FeeConfig` storage with fee disabled by default and collector defaulting to the admin.
- Fee-enforced `create_attestation` flow that transfers the configured token amount to the fee collector before persisting the attestation.

- `get_attestation(attestation_id)` — fetch full attestation data by ID.
- `get_attestation_status(attestation_id)` — return `Valid`, `Expired`, or `Revoked`; emits an `expired` event when status is `Expired`.
- `has_valid_claim(subject, claim_type)` — returns `true` if the subject holds a non-expired, non-revoked attestation of the given type; emits an `expired` event for any expired attestation encountered.
- `get_subject_attestations(subject, start, limit)` — paginated list of attestation IDs for a subject.
- `get_issuer_attestations(issuer, start, limit)` — paginated list of attestation IDs issued by an issuer.
- Events: `created`, `revoked`, and `expired` emitted on the respective state transitions/checks.
